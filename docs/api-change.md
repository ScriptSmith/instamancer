# The Instagram API has changed
Because of the way instamancer works, when Instagram changes the API for their web frontend, the data that Instamancer gathers will be affected.

If you see this warning, you can:

- Check for [updates](https://github.com/ScriptSmith/instamancer/releases). A new version of instamancer may have been released.
- Look reports in [open issues](https://github.com/ScriptSmith/instamancer/issues). Maybe someone else is having this problem, and is already working on a fix.
- Open a [new issue](https://github.com/ScriptSmith/instamancer/issues/new/choose) if you can't find an existing one.
- Create a fork of the repository and [fix the typings](https://github.com/ScriptSmith/instamancer/blob/master/utils/validation-generator/README.md#fix-typings) yourself.
